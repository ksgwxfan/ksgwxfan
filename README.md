## Kyle S. Gentry
### Meteorologist - UNC-Charlotte, December 2017

Hey, I'm Kyle. During my time in college, I was introduced to computer programming. It has been one of the most rewarding and challenging skills I gained while attending UNCC. I learned `C++` and `Fortran` to begin, but adopted `Python` as my goto language, and now I barely even remember any of the former two, lol. I've also picked-up `HTML5/CSS/Javascript`, which has also been very cool to learn.

With `Python`, I have primarily focused on ingest and inspection of data-sets including `HURDAT2` and `GHCN-Daily` station data. And my HTML/CSS/JS skills have largely been attained through maintainence of my core website, [ksgwxfan.github.io](https://ksgwxfan.github.io). It really opened up my skill-set. Reflecting on early iterations of what's on my site now, my coding (and understanding) has come a long way. I'm not the fastest learner when it comes to programming, but when something "clicks," the discovery is quite thrilling.

I like working for concision in my code. Whether it be spatial concision (reducing lines of code) or temporal concision (making it faster), it helps me feel that I progressed my code.
